# LyricGenerator
A microservice where a user can Search for songs/artists, retrieve the lyrics, background info, and spotify player of the song,
as well as favorite the song and see all favorited songs. 

UPDATE: At this point I've spent 4 days trying to deploy the web application to heroku but I keep encountering issues trying to deploy.


For now, you should clone the repository, npm install in both client and backend, and then npm run(for client) and node index.js(for backend --cd into routes first). Application runs on Localhost:3000, backend runs on localhost:3001.

Used: 
ReactJS --Frontend

Express.js/Node.js --Backend

MongoDb Node.js Driver --Backend
